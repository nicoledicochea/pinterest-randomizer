Effective Date: [Current Date]

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your App Name] ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your information.

**1. Information We Collect**

The App connects to your Pinterest account using the Pinterest API to access your boards and the pins (images) within them. We do not collect or store any of your personal information on our servers, including your name, email, or Pinterest account details. Your Pinterest access token is used only for the duration of your session to make API calls to Pinterest and is not stored after you close the application.

**2. How We Use Information**

All data accessed from the Pinterest API (boards and pins) is used on a temporary basis to provide the core functionality of the Appâ€”randomly selecting images for your personal use. The App does not share your data with any third parties.

**3. Your Control Over Your Information**

Because we do not store any of your personal information, you have full control of your data through your Pinterest account settings. You can revoke the App's access at any time in your Pinterest account settings.

**4. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
