### Implementation Plan: Pinterest Image Randomizer

This plan outlines the steps for building a front-end application using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS to get random images for drawing inspiration from your Pinterest boards.

---

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup (MVP)

1.  **Project Scaffolding:** Use a modern tool like **Vite** to create a new React and TypeScript project. This is a faster and more up-to-date alternative to `create-react-app`.
    * `npm create vite@latest`
    * Choose `React` and `TypeScript`.
2.  **Tooling Integration:**
    * **Node.js:** While the front-end is React, Node.js will be essential for creating a back-end to handle API calls securely. This prevents exposing your API keys directly in the client-side code.
    * **Tailwind CSS:** Install and configure Tailwind CSS in your project. This is generally straightforward with Vite. You'll need to install the necessary packages and configure the `tailwind.config.js` file to scan your component files.
3.  **Pinterest API:** This is the core of your application's functionality. The official Pinterest API allows you to access a user's boards and the pins within them.
    * You'll need a Pinterest developer account to get API access.
    * The API documentation shows endpoints for getting a user's boards (`/v5/boards`) and the pins on a specific board (`/v5/boards/{board_id}/pins`).
    * Your Node.js back-end will handle the OAuth 2.0 flow for user authorization and then make the API calls.

### Phase 2: MVP Development

1.  **Back-end API (Node.js):**
    * Create a simple server using Express.js (a Node.js framework).
    * Implement an endpoint for user authentication with the Pinterest API (OAuth).
    * Create a proxy endpoint to fetch a list of a user's boards from the Pinterest API.
    * Create another endpoint that takes a board ID and fetches all the pins (images) from that board.
2.  **Front-end Components (React + TypeScript):**
    * **Authentication Component:** A simple login button that redirects the user to the Pinterest OAuth flow. After the user grants permission, the app receives a token that can be used for API calls.
    * **Board Selection Component:** After a successful login, fetch and display a list of the user's Pinterest boards. This component should allow the user to select one board.
    * **Image Display Component:** Once a board is selected, fetch all the pins from that board. This component will then handle the random selection logic.
        * Implement a function to randomly select a pin from the fetched list of pins.
        * Display the selected image.
        * Include a "Randomize" button to trigger the random selection again.
3.  **Styling (Tailwind CSS):**
    * Use Tailwind's utility-first classes to style all the components.
    * Focus on a clean and simple UI for the MVP. You can use flexbox or grid utilities for layout and a few color classes for buttons and backgrounds.

### Phase 3: Future Improvements (Beyond MVP)

1.  **Multiple Image Randomization:** Modify the front-end logic to select and display five random images at a time instead of just one. The user can then choose their favorite.
2.  **Multi-Board Randomization:** Enhance the back-end and front-end to allow the user to select multiple boards. The app would then fetch all pins from all selected boards and randomize from the combined pool.
