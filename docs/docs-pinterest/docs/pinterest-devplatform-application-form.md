A personal tool to help find drawing inspiration from Pinterest boards.

The core idea is to bypass the overwhelming number of images I've saved in my own boards by automating the selection process. Instead of manually scrolling through hundreds of pins, the app will:

Display a list of my Pinterest boards.
Let me select a single board.
Randomly select and display one image from that board for drawing inspiration.

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will focus on this simple, single-board functionality. Future improvements could include the ability to randomize from multiple boards at once or display a choice of five images instead of just one for more choice.
